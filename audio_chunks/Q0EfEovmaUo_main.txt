If you have time, an extra hour in your life, what would you do? Now, not too surprisingly, people did not say things like they would be grocery shopping, or answering emails, or paying bills, or doing the laundry. They said they would pick up a hobby like gardening, they might be meeting up with friends, or streaming a video, or playing a game. Except that when I changed the frame, things got different. I asked them, "Imagine that you have an extra hour today, in your life today. What would you do then?" Now, almost twice as many people said that they would do work tasks. When we are thinking about our time as a maximally used resource, we are actually shooting ourselves in the foot. We are doing something that we are not intending to do. Next time you feel like you think about the time you have as a resource to be maximized, push it into the back of your head. Try to reframe it as the medium through which you live and see whether it makes a difference.
