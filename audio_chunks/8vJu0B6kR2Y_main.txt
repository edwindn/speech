In the summer of 2014, I found myself sitting across from a man who, by every definition, was my enemy. His name was Craig Watts and he's a chicken factory farmer. My career is devoted to protecting farmed animals and ending factory farming. Over the next few months, I returned many times with filmmaker Regan Hodge to record, to understand, to build trust with Craig. And working with Craig got me thinking, what other unlikely allies are out there? The first lesson I learned is that we have to become comfortable with being uncomfortable. Only talking to people who agree with us, it's not going to get us to the solution. We have to be willing to enter other people's space, because quite often, the enemy has the power to change the problem that we're trying to solve.
