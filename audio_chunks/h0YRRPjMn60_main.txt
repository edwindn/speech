Have you ever tried talking to your partner about money? How did that argument go? There are five things to consider when discussing personal finances with your partner. Contribution, transparency, values, equality, and vision. Research tells us that the partner with greater income, education, or age tends to hold more financial power in a relationship. But it's important that we create equality for both partners regardless of these factors. Each partner's voice should be respected and acknowledged regularly, and actually talking about money fosters knowledge and experience, and ultimately leads to greater financial success for both partners.
