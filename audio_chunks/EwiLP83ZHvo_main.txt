I'm going to share three tips to help you improve your communication around money and relationships, the three don'ts before saying "I do." Tip number one: Do not ignore red flags. Tip number two: Do not leave yourself unprotected. Many people think that prenuptial agreements are for the rich-rich. I disagree. And if your partner has an allergic reaction to this idea, circle back to tip number one. Do not ignore red flags. And last, but certainly not least, don't be afraid to walk away. Even if you and your partner have differing views on money, you can still have a successful relationship. Most conflict in relationships stems from not having much-needed conversations, or having conversations but ending them too soon. I encourage you and your partner to have one courageous conversation around money this week. If you can communicate about money, you can communicate about almost anything.
